Finally this is also important to initialize the first step in professional world by making a real world project. 



## Features

- An Intelligence Symptom checker
- More accurate Cancer Diagnosis
- Diagnosing various Deadly body Diseases faster.
- Able to detect earlier stage of Heart, Liver, Malaria and Pneumonia.
- Also give guidance to how to cure from diseases. [coming soon]
- Analysis world wide spread disease. [coming soon]
- Include various graphs and Charts for better visualization.[coming soon]
